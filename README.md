## Purpose

The purpose of this README is to guide you through the process of hosting and formatting your resume on GitHub Pages, effectively applying the principles of modern technical writing as detailed in Andrew Etter's *Modern Technical Writing*. This document not only instructs on the technical steps but also relates each step to Etter's broader recommendations for effective technical communication, emphasizing the use of lightweight markup (Markdown), distributed version control (GitHub), and static site generators.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A resume formatted in Markdown. Markdown is a simple, readable markup language designed for formatting text on the web. If you're new to Markdown, no worriesâ€”it's designed to be easy to learn. And I've prepared a [link](#More-Resources) to the *Markdown Guide* in the More Resource section.
- A GitHub account. GitHub will serve as the platform for hosting your resume via GitHub Pages.


## Instructions

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

**Related Principle**: Utilize distributed version control systems for collaboration and versioning.

**Practical Step**: Sign into your GitHub account and create a new repository named **`<yourusername>.github.io`**, replacing **`<yourusername>`** with your GitHub username. This will host your static site (your resume) on GitHub Pages.

### 2. Add Your Resume in Markdown Format

**Related Principle**: Adopt lightweight markup languages for their simplicity and versatility.

**Practical Step**: In your repository, create a file named **`index.md`** and paste your Markdown-formatted resume into this file. Markdown facilitates document formatting in a readable manner, easily convertible into HTML for web presentation.

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages for Your Repository

**Related Principle**: Leverage static site generators to automate webpage generation from plain text content.

**Practical Step**: Navigate to your repository settings, find the GitHub Pages section, and select the main branch as the source. GitHub Pages will automatically render your Markdown file into a static website using Jekyll, a popular static site generator.

### 4. Customize Your Page

**Related Principle**: Focus on simplicity and user experience in design.

**Practical Step**: Customize your resume's web presentation by selecting a Jekyll theme or editing the CSS directly. This step enhances the visual appeal of your resume, though it remains optional based on personal preference.

### 5. Update and Maintain Your Resume

**Related Principle**: Keep documentation current and maintain it regularly.

**Practical Step**: Whenever you need to update your resume, simply commit changes to the **`index.md`** file in your repository. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site with the changes.

### 6. View Your Resume on Your Static Website

**Related Principle**: Test and review your documentation.

**Practical Step**: Once GitHub Pages is enabled and your resume is uploaded, you can view your static website by navigating to https://<yourusername>.github.io. This URL will display your Markdown-formatted resume as a web page, allowing you to review and ensure everything is correctly formatted and publicly accessible.


## Animated GIF Demo

Include an animated gif showing the process of editing, committing, and viewing changes to your resume on GitHub Pages. Ensure your own name is visible in the resume demo.

## FAQs

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor for documentation?

Markdown is preferred for its simplicity, readability, and ease of conversion into HTML or other formats. It allows writers to focus on content rather than formatting and is universally compatible across different platforms and editors.

### Why is my resume not showing up on GitHub Pages?

Ensure you've named your repository `<yourusername>.github.io` and that your resume is in the `index.md` file. Also, check if GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings. It may take a few minutes for changes to go live, so be patient.
